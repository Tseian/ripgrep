# Project Configuration Review and Update

I have reviewed the project and identified a key issue regarding the package distribution size and the need for documentation.

## Issues Identified
1.  **Package Size**: The root `package.json` lacks a `files` field or `.npmignore`. This would cause the `vendor/` directory (containing all platform binaries) to be included in the root package, defeating the purpose of `optionalDependencies`.
2.  **Documentation**: The `README.md` needs to be updated to reflect the multi-platform nature of the package and provide usage/development instructions.

## Plan
1.  **Optimize Root Package**:
    - Update `package.json` to include `"files": ["index.js", "README.md"]`. This ensures only necessary files are published in the root package, while binaries are downloaded via platform-specific dependencies.

2.  **Update Documentation (`README.md`)**:
    - **Installation**: How to install via npm.
    - **Architecture**: Explain how the multi-platform distribution works (Root package + OS-specific optional dependencies).
    - **Development**:
        - How to add new platforms.
        - **Release Process**: Explain that the GitHub Action automatically publishes all packages on push to `main`.
    - **Troubleshooting**: What to do if the correct platform package isn't installed.

3.  **Verify**:
    - Ensure `ci.yml` is correctly set up (already done, but will double-check context).
    - Ensure `index.js` logic is sound (confirmed).

This plan ensures a lightweight root package and clear instructions for users and maintainers.
